# Sudoku Puzzle Generator and Solver

This project provides a Sudoku puzzle generator and solver with varying levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane). The program is implemented in Python and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame.

## Features

- **Sudoku Puzzle Generation**: Generates Sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels using a backtracking algorithm. The puzzles are generated such that they have a unique solution.
- **Sudoku Puzzle Solver**: Solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The solver can work on user-input puzzles or those generated by the program.
- **Difficulty Assessment**: The difficulty level of a Sudoku puzzle is assessed based on the number of guesses required to solve it. This assessment is compared with human-assigned difficulty levels.
- **Hints Functionality**: The GUI allows users to request hints, where the program will fill in the next correct value for the user.
- **Interactive GUI**: The Pygame-based interface allows users to interactively select difficulty levels, enter numbers, request hints, and solve puzzles.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

To install Pygame, run:

\`\`\`bash
pip install pygame
\`\`\`

## Usage

Run the main script to start the Sudoku game:

\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

The GUI will open, allowing you to select the difficulty level and interact with the puzzle.

## Algorithm Overview

The Sudoku puzzle generator is based on a backtracking algorithm that generates puzzles with a unique solution. The difficulty of the puzzle is judged by the number of guesses required to solve it.

### Oversimplification of Difficulty Assessment

The algorithm's difficulty assessment is based on the number of guesses required to solve the puzzle, which is an oversimplification for the following reasons:

1. **Non-guessing Solutions**: Some difficult puzzles can be solved without guessing but require specific strategies to determine the next move.
2. **Number Positioning**: The positioning of numbers in relation to each other can significantly affect the difficulty, which this method does not fully account for.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Browser Extension**: Convert this code into a browser extension to help users solve their puzzles directly in the browser.
2. **Research Comparisons**: Compare the backtracking algorithm's solving time on puzzles from old Sudoku books (where difficulty is judged by humans) with the time on puzzles generated by this program.
3. **Difficulty Assessment Adjustment**: Modify the generating function to assess the difficulty of user-input puzzles and compare this to the difficulty assigned by humans.
4. **Graph Analysis**: Analyze the performance of the algorithm on puzzles with the same number of initial vacant positions but different distributions, potentially as a math modeling project.

## Research Insights

The algorithm relies on the number of guesses a user must make to solve the puzzle, which is considered an oversimplification. However, a more sophisticated approach would involve studying the distribution of the numbers and the squares, making this more of a mathematical research problem. The following points highlight the limitations:

1. **Human Solver Steps**: Difficult puzzles might be solved without guessing if one knows where to start solving them. Current research estimates the steps a human solver will take to solve a puzzle.
2. **Number Positioning**: The difficulty can also be influenced by how the numbers are positioned relative to each other.
